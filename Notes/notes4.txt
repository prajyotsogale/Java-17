Reading data from console

Techniques        							Description

System.in      like System.out java provides System.in which can read input from the console or 
			   terminal. It is not easy to use for beginners, and lots of code has been build around it, to make it easier.
			   
System.console This is java's solution for easier support for easier support for reading a single 
			   line and prompting user for information. Although this is easy to use, it doesn't 
			   with IDE's because these environments disable it.

Command line   This is calling the java program and specifying data in the call. This is very
Arguments      commonly used but doesn't let us create an interactive application in a loop in java

Scanner        The Scanner class was built to be a common way to read input, either System.in or a 
			   file. For beginners, it's much easier to understand than the bare bone System.in





Exception is an error that happens in code.

try{
	//Statement that might get errors 
}catch(Exception e){
	//exception e is the type of error
	//code to 'handle' the exception or code to react when the exception caught
}



Scanner class is described as a simple text scanner, which can parse primitive types and 
strings
to use Scanner Class, we have to create an instance of Scanner
we use keyword 'new'
the new keyword is used in what java calls, a Class Instance Creation Expression.

ClassName variableName = new ClassName();

And often in many classes, we can pass paramenters in parentheses, as we saw with methods.

ClassName variableName = new ClassName(argument1, argument2);


Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

file is anothe class in java for reading and writing files

Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("nameofFileonFileSystem"));


//in this case java provides library of code, which includes scanner classes
import java.util.Scanner;
