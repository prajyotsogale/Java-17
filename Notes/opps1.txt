pojo = plain old java object 
getters and setters and private;
default constructor and toString

record in java  -- java calls them plain data carriers
immutable
create new file of record
public record LPAStudent(String id, String name, String dob, String classList){
	
}
this will automatically have getters,toString, constructor but not setters
the part in the parenthesis is called record header
String id,... are called fields
these are declared private and final
LPAStudent rec = new...
rec.name() -- no getName!!

no setters cause its immutable
